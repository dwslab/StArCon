 * You need to slightly modify the class as follows:
 *   -  Replace the first line by "package utils;"
 *   -  Delete the main method: Lines 558-581
 *   -  Delete unused imports: Lines 4-7
 * Note: If you paste the class directly below this comment, you need to add 10 to the line numbers above of course :)
