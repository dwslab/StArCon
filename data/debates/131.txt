question	Are charter schools a good idea? In New Orleans?
headline_1	Performance: Are charter schools and students performing better?
pro_1_1	Charter schools are performing better than public schools	 Charter schools are performing better than public schools Scot Lehigh. "A strong case for more charter schools". Boston Globe. January 7, 2009 - "Compared with students in traditional schools, charter school students are doing significantly better in math and English, according to the analysis by researchers from Harvard and MIT."
pro_1_2	Adaptive charter schools can make necessary changes	 Adaptive charter schools can make necessary changes Jonathan Bertsch, KIPP's director of operations in New Orleans, said in a June 2008 Washington Post article: "The main difference is that most of the charters have the freedom to change, to get better, to hire the people they need to make the school better." [1]
con_1_1	Charter schools perform no better than public schools	 Charter schools perform no better than public schools "Reining in Charter Schools". New York Times (Editorial). May 10, 2006 - "several studies have shown that on the whole, charter schools perform no better than other public schools."
con_1_2	Competition created by charter schools distracts from the classroom	 Competition created by charter schools distracts from the classroom "Reining in Charter Schools". New York Times (Editorial). May 10, 2006 - "uncertainty has created budgeting havoc and simply forced the diversion of much of the attention of district leaders away from the classroom as a matter of financial survival. Every year, there were schools to close and costs to cut. Three years after the first charter school opened, Dayton had slipped to last in the state’s rating system â€” worse even than Cleveland, the traditional testing doormat in Ohio. Three years later, Dayton still is at the bottom."
con_1_3	Charter schools proliferated too quickly to monitor	 Charter schools proliferated too quickly to monitor "Reining in Charter Schools". New York Times (Editorial). May 10, 2006: "some states have opened so many charter programs so quickly that they can barely count them, let alone monitor student performance."
headline_2	Teachers: Do charter schools promote better teachers and teaching?
pro_2_1	Charter school administrators can hand-pick the best teachers	 Charter school administrators can hand-pick the best teachers New Orleans' Fischer Elementary School principal Dahme Bolden was quoted in an October 2006 NPR article saying: "The difference [between the former system and new charter schools] is I can hand-pick my teachers. As a result, I see more leadership from the teaching staff, [more] enthusiasm, I see more teaching and learning going on."[2]
pro_2_2	Competition b/w teachers in charter schools incentivizes performance	 Competition b/w teachers in charter schools incentivizes performance New Orleans KIPP Believe College Prep school teacher Scarlet Feinberg said in a October 2006 NPR article: "It's great pressure, I mean it's pressure that makes you work harder, that gives you a sense of urgency every day that they must learn these skills. If you don't produce the results that need to be produced, it's very possible that you could lose your job."[3]
pro_2_3	Charter schools promote teacher independence and character	 Charter schools promote teacher independence and character Elly Jo Rael. "A Summary of Arguments For and Against Charter Schools": "Charter schools promote teacher autonomy and empowerment. Due to decreased regulation teachers can maintain a greater sense of freedom to develop their own unique styles of pedagogy, and are able to adopt new methods without fear of administrative sanctions. Thus, the best teachers in the educational system will be attracted by higher levels of autonomy. Furthermore, by empowering teachers, charter schools will increase teacher motivation and innovation making the profession attractive." 
con_2_1	Charter school competition distracts from teaching	 Charter school competition distracts from teaching "Reining in Charter Schools". New York Times (Editorial). May 10, 2006 - "uncertainty has created budgeting havoc and simply forced the diversion of much of the attention of district leaders away from the classroom as a matter of financial survival. Every year, there were schools to close and costs to cut. Three years after the first charter school opened, Dayton had slipped to last in the state’s rating system â€” worse even than Cleveland, the traditional testing doormat in Ohio. Three years later, Dayton still is at the bottom."
con_2_2	Charter schools spend more on administration	 Charter schools spend more on administration Deborah Bach. "School Board digs in against charter schools". Seattle PI. December 17, 2003 - "The Seattle School Board intends to make a pre-emptive strike against charter school legislation that came close to passing last session, despite being turned down by voters twice in the past. [...] At its Jan. 7 meeting, the board is expected to adopt a resolution opposing charter schools. [...] The proposed resolution cites a study last year by the American Federation of Teachers that found that charter schools spend a greater percentage of their resources on administration, less on infrastructure and provide fewer services than the districts they reside in."  
con_2_3	Charter schools actively resist teacher unionization	 Charter schools actively resist teacher unionization Seth Sandronsky. "Rethinking Charter Schools". Weekend Edition. September 27, 2008 - "Charter schools, begun two decades ago to spur innovation in learning and teaching, have been a force to push out labor unions. It is common for teachers at charter schools to be at-will employees, with no job protections." 
headline_3	Mission: Are the missions of charter schools sound?
pro_3_1	The mission focus of charter schools helps promote success	 The mission focus of charter schools helps promote success "Contracting for Success: Charter Schools Offer Choice". Duke University. Summer 2005 - "The charter that establishes each school is a performance contract detailing the school’s mission, program, goals, enrollment limits, assessment methods, and criteria for success. Approval of the charter is contingent on a clearly described instructional program. Most charters are granted for three to five years, but they can be revoked if the state determines that student achievement has not been demonstrated or that the terms of the contract have not been met."
pro_3_2	Charter schools focus more on behavior and self-esteem	 Charter schools focus more on behavior and self-esteem "Charter Schools' Big Experiment". Washington Post. June 9, 2008 - "many New Orleans parents are embracing charter schools. Shajuandra Steptore, a nursing student, said she was not impressed by the regular public schools that her bright but sometimes troublesome daughter A'sha attended before the hurricane. When Alford's school opened, Steptore said, she was drawn to its promise 'to focus on behavior and on self-esteem.' After a year at Langston Hughes, A'sha is finishing fifth grade. Her behavior has improved along with her reading and math, and Steptore plans to keep her in charters permanently." 
pro_3_3	Charter schools can unconventionally reward student success	 Charter schools can unconventionally reward student success Michael Kunzelman. "In Post-Katrina New Orleans, Educators, Students Embrace Charter Schools". Associated Press - "Beignet rewards. Indeed, KIPP schools employ virtually theatrical teaching methods and routines. Teachers and students frequently interact through singing, chanting, and hand gestures. 'Sparking' in the classroom means sitting up, paying attention, asking and answering questions. Students earn a weekly 'paycheck' that rewards good behavior with treats like hot cocoa and beignets, the fried pastries that are a signature snack in New Orleans.' Lessons on behavior are as much a part of the school's curriculum as reading, writing, and arithmetic."
pro_3_4	Charter schools are a type of public school for public benefit	 Charter schools are a type of public school for public benefit Charter schools are generally considered part of state public school systems, as they can receive public funding, so they have the must have the public interest at heart.
pro_3_5	Charter schools combine the best of public and private schools.	Charter schools combine the best of public and private schools. Charter schools are taxpayer-funded, and so free to the public, like public schools. Yet, charter schools are free of many state regulations, making them particularly adaptive and responsive to student needs, much like private schools. The combination of these two strengths makes charter schools a very attractive option for students.
con_3_1	Charter schools are unaccountable and dictatorial	 Charter schools are unaccountable and dictatorial Charter schools are not bound by the same regulations that exist on public schools, nor by the democratic processes that make it possible for citizens to pressure public school administrators. This make them less accountable to the desires of a community. 
con_3_2	Different policies in every charter school creates confusion	 Different policies in every charter school creates confusion Sarah Carr. "Parent blasts New Orleans charter school's expulsion process". The Times-Picayune. December 10, 2008: "Expulsion practices vary at charter schools across the city, and there can be gaps in coordination with the Recovery School District, which ends up accepting many students expelled from charters."  
con_3_3	Charter schools create two-tiers; lets public schools fail	 Charter schools create two-tiers; lets public schools fail Charter schools, and the competition they introduce, produce a two-tiered education system in which public schools are essentially abandoned for what are supposedly better charter schools. This is because charter schools have the power to deny students enrollments if they do not qualify, generally on the basis of merit. This stands in contrast to public schools that must accept those in the district that enroll. The problem is that this creates an "exclusive" tier in the public schooling system, leaving public schools with those that are "less qualified". This degrades public schools and their intellectual environment, and makes it harder for public schools to show statistical improvements and obtain needed funding. Instead of this, why not make public schools work for all students, including the gifted and less gifted.
con_3_4	Public schools can offer everything charter schools claim	 Public schools can offer everything charter schools claim Larry Kuehn. "Ten Problems with Charter Schools". British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "The concerns of most parents can be addressed by the current system. Many program options are currently offered in public schools and schools are increasingly open to program options. Particular languages, areas of focus such as the arts, and special needs are already met by programs within the public schools. This approach better serves the public good than setting up what are often essentially private schools with full public funding. Parent advisory committees, mandated in the School Act, provide an opportunity for parents to provide input into the school policies."
con_3_5	Charter schools fragment society with scattered education values	 Charter schools fragment society with scattered education values The many different missions and values of charter schools means that we do not adopt a single core set of values upon which to educate our children. Creating fragmentation in this way among members of society is a bad idea.
headline_4	Choice: Do charter schools offer beneficial choices to parents/students?
pro_4_1	Charter schools offer parents choices in public schools	 Charter schools offer parents choices in public schools John McCain said in the last US presidential debate in October 2008: "Charter schools aren’t the only answer, but they’re providing competition…choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that’s already been proven in places like New Orleans and New York City and other places."[4]
pro_4_2	Charter schools are based on funding students not schools	 Charter schools are based on funding students not schools Bruno Manno. "The Case Against Charter Schools". School Administrator. May 2001. - "Allegation No. 1: Charter schools rob funds and students from regular public schools. While they may benefit a few youngsters, they hurt those left behind by biting into district budgets. [...] While it is true that charter funds are typically subtracted from district revenues, that is because their students are subtracted from district rolls. The fundamental concept of any school choice regimen is that the money follows the child to the school the family selects. Public dollars are meant to be spent for the education of that particular student, not entitlements for school systems. The premise of the allegation is backwards."
pro_4_3	Charter school choice helps pressure school boards to reform	 Charter school choice helps pressure school boards to reform Elly Jo Rael. "A Summary of Arguments For and Against Charter Schools" - "Charter schools add financial pressure to break up inertia. Putting financial pressure on the public schools is the only way to force them to change. As mentioned before, parent and student choice pressures schools to be accountable, and to accommodate their interests. If public schools fail to address concerns and interests, then they will ultimately lose students in their respective districts and a given percentage of per pupil expenditures." 
con_4_1	Many factors constrain choice introduced by charter schools	 Many factors constrain "choice" introduced by charter schools Larry Kuehn. "Ten Problems with Charter Schools". British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "Hidden impediments get in the way of real choice. [...] Proponents of "choice" through charter schools often claim that the choice is open for any parents. In practice, hidden factors, such as the cost of transportation or the lack of skills to take part in meetings, get in the way of any real opportunities for many to choose. A case study on one California district demonstrated that a school choice program designed to overcome economic inequities resulted in increasing stratification because of these hidden factors. [...] As James Guthrie told Education Week, 'let me tell you why schools aren't like chocolate bars. When you or I eat a chocolate bar, the gratification and the effect is virtually immediate. Schools have a lagged effect, some of the consequences of which are not immediately evident.' In the absence of data, he says, 'parents will make a judgment based on the social class of students.'"

British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "The concerns of most parents can be addressed by the current system.

This approach better serves the public good than setting up what are often essentially private schools with full public funding. Parent advisory committees, mandated in the School Act, provide an opportunity for parents to provide input into the school policies."
headline_5	Competition: Do charter schools foster beneficial competition?
pro_5_1	Charter schools spur competition that forces all schools to improve	 Charter schools spur competition that forces all schools to improve Charter schools add a new model into the mix, in addition to private and public schools. For both private and public schools to survive in the face of charter schools, they must improve themselves. In this sense, competition with charter schools will improve private and public schools.
pro_5_2	Charter schools stimulate competition to enroll students	 Charter schools stimulate competition to enroll students Charter schools compete with other schools for students. This creates positive movement toward fuller enrollment, including of disadvantaged students.
pro_5_3	Regulations restrict charter schools and their competitiveness	 Regulations restrict charter schools and their competitiveness Elly Jo Rael. "A Summary of Arguments For and Against Charter Schools" - "Charter schools do not create school competition. The instability of reform laws, lack of adequate funding, the lack of a profit motive, and many remaining restrictions on who can establish a charter school and how it can be run will restrict their creation, as will the lack of technical assistance, start-up capital, and facilities. The application process (e.g. through a local school board) and accountability procedures (e.g. annual standardized tests) will both restrict the number of charter schools and reduce the variation between them. Most state laws also restrict the number of charter schools allowed." 
pro_5_4	Public schools are cushioned from enrollment losses to charter schools	 Public schools are cushioned from enrollment losses to charter schools "Does Charter School Competition Improve Traditional Public Schools?". Manhattan Institute for Public Policy. June 10, 2000 - We studied Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, Jersey City and Trenton, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia (D.C.), to appraise how charter schools are affecting the traditional public school system.2 We found that charter competition has not induced large changes in district-wide operations, despite the fact that a significant number of students have left district schools for charter schools. [...] This may be explained by the fact that state policies generally cushion districts from the financial effects of departing students. Demographics play a role, too. Rising total enrollments, a by-product of the 'baby boom echo,' and recent high rates of immigration, have helped districts avoid fiscal pain; some have maintained absolute enrollment (and budget) levels even as their market share has shrunk."
con_5_1	Funded charter schools are not in open market competition	 Funded charter schools are not in open market competition Charter shools, which often receive public and private funding, cannot be said to be engaged in an open market of competition. As such, the efficiencies and benefits of the markets and competition do not apply.
con_5_2	Schools are not like businesses; can't just let bad ones die	 Schools are not like businesses; can't just let bad ones die Scott Elliott. "The case against charter schools in Dayton". Dayton Daily. November 12, 2005 - "schools are not mutual funds. If you pick a mutual fund, all you care about is performance. If it starts to lose money, you dump it. Schools are much more complicated. Once you pick one for your child, it’s awfully hard to switch. You arrange your life around the school’s schedule, your child makes friends. It’s more than a business relationship. It’s an emotional investment. And those ties are awfully tough to sever, even if the school’s performance is disappointing." 
con_5_3	Entrepreneurs exploit corrupt officials to create charter schools	 Entrepreneurs exploit corrupt officials to create charter schools Seth Sandronsky. "Rethinking Charter Schools". Weekend Edition. September 27, 2008 - "In New Orleans, public officials and charter school operators exploited the awful devastation from Hurricane Katrina and shameful reaction of FEMA to turn the city’s schools upside down. Consider this. 'In one short year, New Orleans had become home to the highest concentration of charter schools in the nation,' writes Leigh Dingerson, a community organizer, educator and co-editor of the collection, along with Barbara Miner, Bob Peterson and Stephanie Walters."
con_5_4	Charter schools compete with and threaten public schools	 Charter schools compete with and threaten public schools Leigh Dingerson, education team leader for the Center for Community Change in the District, says Louisiana school authorities have "opened a flea market of entrepreneurial opportunism [with charter schools] that is dismantling the institution of public education in New Orleans."[7] 
con_5_5	Charter schools are damaging private schools	 Charter schools are damaging private schools Scott Elliott. "The case against charter schools in Dayton". Dayton Daily. November 12, 2005 - "unexpectedly, charters have also devastated private schools. The trend line is stark. Private schools were having a strong decade in the 1990s. Many hit 10-year enrollment peaks in 1999, just as charter were getting off the ground. [...] Five years later, private school enrollment was collapsing â€” better than three-quarters hit 10-year enrollment lows. I just pulled updated private school enrollment data last week â€”Â since 2003, 18 of 20 Dayton private schools saw enrollment drops. This is no coincidence."
con_5_6	Charter schools can destroy valuable neighborhood schools	 Charter schools can destroy valuable neighborhood schools Larry Kuehn. "Ten Problems with Charter Schools". British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "A charter school could mean the end of a neighbourhood school. [...] If charter schools become part of the school system, some existing schools would be converted from neighbourhood schools to charter schools. This would mean that the neighbourhood public school would not necessarily be accessible to everyone who lives in the neighbourhood."
headline_6	Economics: Are charter schools more economical?
pro_6_1	Charter schools offer fewer services, reducing operating costs	 Charter schools offer fewer services, reducing operating costs "Contracting for Success: Charter Schools Offer Choice". Duke University. Summer 2005 - "Because charter schools often do not offer the same services that traditional public schools do, their operating costs tend to be lower. Bus transportation, for example, is usually not available to charter school students. This lack of transportation may limit enrollment to students who live nearby or have other transportation options."
pro_6_2	Charter schools, free from regulation, are innovative	 Charter schools, free from regulation, are innovative Scott Elliot. "The case for charter schools in Dayton". Dayton Daily. November 12, 2005 - "Innovation is a prime byproduct of the entrepreneurial spirit that independent school operators bring to the table. Before competition, the school district had no incentive to pursue Higdon’s innovative ideas. Today, more educators in Dayton are thinking outside the box than ever."
pro_6_3	Agile charter schools can quickly respond to meet demand	 Agile charter schools can quickly respond to meet demand In the aftermath of Katrina, Jeanne Allen, president of the pro-charter Center for Education Reform, said in a Washington Post article: "Charter educators and friends took games and books and organized dozens of small classrooms while the national government scratched its head over what to do."[8]
pro_6_4	Charter schools can generate strong funding from foundations	 Charter schools can generate strong funding from foundations Matthew Yglesias. "The Case for Charter Schools". Thank Progress. September 19, 2008 - "it’s important to understand that the charter schools that have shown the most impressive results get substantial additional funding from foundations and other charitable sources over and above their public funding. The evidence, in other words, suggests that structural reform in the direction of more charter schools is a necessary complement to more funding, but not a substitute for it."
pro_6_5	Charter schools make good use of empty school buildings	 Charter schools make good use of empty school buildings Robert Holland, Senior Fellow at the Heartland Institute. "Use the empty school buildings". Washington Post. August 9, 2008 - "Across the nation, charter school operators report that finding adequate space is their single biggest challenge. Fearing competition, officialdom often hoards surplus property that could house these independently managed public schools. [...] One might think that things would be different in the District, where charter schools have been a lifeline for families more than they have been just about anywhere else in the United States ["Respect for Charter Schools," editorial, Aug. 4]. Long a model of education failure, Washington has a chance to be an exemplar of urban education reform, largely because of its charter schools, which now serve almost one-third of the city's schoolchildren. Yet D.C. officials are being super-stingy about letting charter operators lease the city's surplus school buildings. [...] Washington's families deserve better. School stewardship should be about what's best for children, not how best to conduct turf wars."
con_6_1	Charter schools contribute to damaging privatization of schools	 Charter schools contribute to damaging privatization of schools Deborah Bach. "School Board digs in against charter schools". Seattle PI. December 17, 2003 - "contributing to the privatization of public schools -- the Senate-backed legislation allows a charter school's board of directors to contract out for supplies and services, including instruction."
con_6_2	Charter schools don't add efficiency, but more administrative costs	 Charter schools don't add efficiency, but more administrative costs Larry Kuehn. "Ten Problems with Charter Schools". British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "Charter schools don't reduce spending on administration. While some have argued that administrative efficiencies will be improved with competition, experience doesn't bear this out. In Britain, grant-maintained schools have spawned new agencies to serve administrative needs. Many individual schools have had to create jobs for people to handle finances; where schools have not, the principal ends up spending a great deal of time on day-to-day business administration, like insurance, benefits, and building repair, rather than educational concerns. The advantages of bulk purchasing and efficiencies of scale are lost, making materials and services more expensive. Salaries of principals in the grant-maintained schools have soared."
con_6_3	Charter schools have a poor return on investment	 Charter schools have a poor return on investment Scott Elliott. "The case against charter schools in Dayton". Dayton Daily. November 12, 2005 - "If charter schools are about free enterprise, markets and bringing business sense to the world of education, then I’ve got three words that the proponents should consider: return on investment. [...] Last year, Ohio spent $424 million on about 250 charter schools statewide. In Dayton alone, the cost was about $45 million on 33 charter schools. So what did we get for our money? [...] Statewide, 71 percent of charter schools were rated in 'academic emergency,' the lowest rating category. [...] In Dayton, no charter schools were rated excellent or effective at the top two rating categories. Many Dayton charters, about 39 percent, got no rating for a variety of reasons, while another 40 percent were rated in academic emergency. [...] And this is part of a continuing pattern."
con_6_4	Charter schools do not achieve economies of scale	 Charter schools do not achieve economies of scale "Reining in Charter Schools". New York Times (Editorial). May 10, 2006 - "Edison has long insisted that its fortunes would improve with "economies of scale." The flaw here is that renovating schools, buying computers and training teachers remain expensive, no matter how many times you do it. Some experts argue that economies of scale do not exist in education, especially in a charter system, where schools are meant to vary in focus and size. In addition, the costs of managing large systems have proved to be high."
con_6_5	Charter schools proliferated too quickly to monitor performance	 Charter schools proliferated too quickly to monitor performance "Reining in Charter Schools". New York Times (Editorial). May 10, 2006: "some states have opened so many charter programs so quickly that they can barely count them, let alone monitor student performance."
headline_7	Diversity: Do charter schools help promote diversity and integration?
pro_7_1	Disadvantaged can afford publicly-funded charter schools	 Disadvantaged can afford publicly-funded charter schools Publicly-funded charter schools are good for the disadvantaged in the same way as public schools; they are free. 
pro_7_2	The disadvantaged deserve access to better schools	 The disadvantaged deserve access to better schools Paul Grogan, president of the Boston Foundation, which funded the research - "There is no justification for keeping a charter cap in place that is denying urban, mostly black and brown children the opportunity for a demonstrably better result."[9]
pro_7_3	Flexibility of charter schools can better serve disadvantaged	 Flexibility of charter schools can better serve disadvantaged Scott Elliot. "The case for charter schools in Dayton". Dayton Daily. November 12, 2005 - "At ISUS, they aggressively recruit dropouts, through juvenile court, word-of-mouth or other referrals. These are kids nobody seemed to care about six years ago. The kids get intensive instruction to try to raise their test scores to the point where they can pass a state exam and graduate. [...] The whole story of ISUS was made possible by the freedom of charter schools. Once the bonds of bureaucracy were broken, Higdon was able to put her innovations into motion and create a remarkable opportunity for kids who were mostly overlooked and ignored in the past."
con_7_1	Charter schools are exploited most by affable students	 Charter schools are exploited most by affable students Larry Kuehn. "Ten Problems with Charter Schools". British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "one school district in California found that its choice programs aimed at equalizing actually increased the disparities. Even in this situation, parents with the most resources took the most advantage of the situation for their children." 
con_7_2	Charter schools can exclude special needs students	 Charter schools can exclude special needs students Larry Kuehn. "Ten Problems with Charter Schools". British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "Charter schools may exclude students with special needs. [...] In a system based on an educational marketplace, students with special needs may detract from the marketability of the school. Research in Britain indicates that the 'most effective strategies are 1. to recruit more students who are likely to perform well academically, and 2. exclude students who are likely not to do well academically. [...] There is concern in Britain over the trend away from integrating children with special needs into the regular classroom. These students are seen as impediments in achieving test scores that can be used to comparison-market the school."
headline_8	Reform: Do charter schools help advance education reform?
pro_8_1	Charter schools can shake-up bureaucracies and institute reforms	 Charter schools can shake-up bureaucracies and institute reforms Scott Elliot. "The case for charter schools in Dayton". Dayton Daily. November 12, 2005 - "The old conventional wisdom in the business community said that the city’s political scene was such that the dysfunctional school board could not be radically changed. There were too many entrenched political interest groups to defeat.
con_8_1	Charter schools are about niche education, not broad reform	 Charter schools are about niche education, not broad reform Larry Kuehn. "Ten Problems with Charter Schools". British Columbia Teachers' Federation. 1995 - "Charter schools don't encourage system reform and improved quality. [...] The theory put forward by many charter school advocates is that the competition of charter schools will lead to reform and improvement to the mainstream of the public schools. [...] In the U.S. and Alberta, most of the charter proposals have been for 'niche schools' that serve a particular special population. Charter schools end up serving special interests, rather than creating programs that develop alternatives that would be offered to most students. They divert money and attention from improving all schools to enhancing a few."
headline_9	New Orleans: Are charter schools in post-Katrina New Orleans a good idea?
pro_9_1	Katrina allowed New Orleans to restart with charter schools	 Katrina allowed New Orleans to restart with charter schools Phyllis Landrieu, member of the New Orleans Parish School Board - "I say in many ways, 'Thank you, Katrina. Immediately, all those problems [with the previous education system] were eliminated, to some extent, and we had an opportunity to start over."[10]
pro_9_2	Charter schools cut through red tape, quickly opening after Katrina	 Charter schools cut through red tape, quickly opening after Katrina Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said in an interview for a June 13, 2006 New York Times article: "Just the fact that the charter schools are the ones that are open is testament to their ability to cut through red tape and be responsive to families where and when they need them."[11]
con_9_1	Charter schools exploited aftermath of Katrina in New Orleans	 Charter schools exploited aftermath of Katrina in New Orleans Daniel Pryzbyla. "Katrina exposed charter school carpetbaggers". EdNews.org. October 1, 2007 - "Katrina's aftermath brought recent and past history onto center stage. Seizing on education 'disasters' was one of them. A dictionary definition for 'carpetbagger' is 'U.S. history; a Northerner who went to the South after the Civil War and became active in Republican politics, esp., as to profiteer from the unsettled social and political conditions of the area during Reconstruction.(2) Any opportunistic or exploitive outsider (1865- 1870).' Welcome to new New Orleans."
