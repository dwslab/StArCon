*  **debates**: This folder contains our parse of the featured debates from [debatepedia.org](http://www.debatepedia.org). Each file contains one debate and is tab-separated. The name of the file is the debate's id. The title is what we call "topic" in our paper. In the lines starting with "pro_" or "con_", the first entry is the argument's summary and the second one the full argument. We want to thank the International Debate Education Association for their permission to publish this data under their CC license, see also [idebate.org](https://idebate.org/).
*  **crowd_annotations**: This folder contains the instructions and results of the crowd annotation process
*  **datasets**: This folder contains the datasets we used in our paper "Unsupervised Stance Detection for Arguments from Consequences". These datasets are subsets from the data provided in the debates-folder.
